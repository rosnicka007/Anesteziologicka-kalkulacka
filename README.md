# Anesteziologicka-kalkulacka
I managed to complete my first major project - an anesthesia calculator for small mammals, based on the use of Python and Tkinter and has practical use in every veterinary practice.
After selecting the animal, the dosing range for 3 anesthetics is set on the sliders, the user himself sets the dose within this range, enters the patient's weight and chooses which preparations he wants to use, and my app calculates the dose of individual anesthetics in milliliters.
I learned a lot of new things while working on this project and I know that I have moved a little further.
